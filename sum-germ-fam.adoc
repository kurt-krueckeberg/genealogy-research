The biography of *Henry Beerman*, on page 299, of The History of the Maumee River Basin, Volume 3. details:

- born in *Glesse, Darmstadt, German, in 1853* but *is that correct? Aren't the Behrman's from north German?*
- Family emigrated in 1855.

According to my Ancestry entry for him, he was born in Glesse, Ottenstein, Niedersachsen or Glesse, Holzminden, Ottenstein Braunschweig, Niedesachsen.

In the 1860 census, the family is listed as "Buchfind", and they lived next to *another "Buchfind" family, with several members!* And both "Buchfind" families head of household have the
same occupation of "Com Lab".
