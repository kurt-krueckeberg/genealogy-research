#--The specific problem with German umlauts is often described as 'dictionary order' or 'phone-book order'. 
#--The Unicode default is okay for the former but if you want 'Ãœ' = 'UE', then you could consider 
#--utf8mb4_de_pb_0900_ai_ci or utf8mb4_german2_ci, assuming character set is utf8mb4.
CREATE DATABASE if not exists imman CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_german2_ci';

#--Create user and grant privileges to the database:
#--GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON imman.* TO 'kurt'@'localhost' identified by 'kk0457';
