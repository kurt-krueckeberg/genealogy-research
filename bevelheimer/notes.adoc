There are several Find-A-grave memorials that have either a short write up or a obituary. These explain that some biblheimers moved from Pennsylvannai to Medina county,
Ohio and later to Adams county, Indiana.

Julia nee Bevelheimer Krick (1832-1906), the first children I know of David Daniel Bevelheimer/Bibelheimer, was born in PA. The next two children, Mary and Daniel,m
were also born in PA. The next XX chilren were born in Ohio, apparently in Median county, Ohio.

Summary:

* According to the 1850 census for  https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/8054/images/4193367-00117?pId=1673022[Union twp, Adams county, Indiana] the older children named
  Mary and Daniel were born in PA. The other children were born in OH? 

* Were any born in Adams county, Indiana?

  gives Julia/Judies place of birth as PA, as well as his husband Jacob Krick.

  - There is an https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37578158/julia-judy-krick[posted obituary for Julia Judy nee Bevelheimer Krick on Find-A-Grave] that is from the "*Weekly Breeze*, which

* The family lived in Ohio. The same census shows the next four children were born in Ohio. Other evidence of Ohio residence comes from his daughter Caroline: 

   - her https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/68081704/person/122415690171/hints[death certificate] shows her birth was in Ohio.
   - tihs image of his Fort Wayne https://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/person/tree/68081704/person/122415690171/hints[obituary] backs this up and
     adds more details.

- The find-a-grave memorial for David Daniel bevelheimer's wife Mary states she died in 1859, I believe, but it isn't until, I believe,
1879 that David Bevelheimer is living with his youngest daugher Isabelle, but the census for that year 
doesn't have "widowed" column. 

- In one census, it states that David's wife has "rheumatism" and that she "can't write", perhaps due to it.

- in 18880, I believe, David Daniel is age 75, a cooper by occupation, living with his wife, who is 5 years younger,
  which is the correct age difference between David and his wife, who may not be his first wife.
