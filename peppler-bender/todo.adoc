== Bender Research

Further Bender research would include

=== Deeds, Plats, Tracks

- Finding all deeds for Johannes and Joahnn Freidrich Bender, who both own land they farmed according to the 1850 Census, in Marion Twp, Allen County.

- Deeds of sale of this land before they moved to Adams township and purchased other land--unless the township borders changed.
  - Therefore, I should seek to find this land also from *Platts* -- orignal surveys and any later -- that would show the land they owned; or from *Tract books*.

=== Probate

Later probate records that describe anything of relevant to this land

=== Church Records

From Sankt Johannis Gemeinde.

The daughter of ??? Bender, ???, is buried in the Sankt Johanis Gemeinde Friedhof.
