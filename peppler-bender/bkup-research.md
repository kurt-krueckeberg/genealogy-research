### Article by Ernst Schmidt, local Rodheim Genealogist, Shows Pepplers Were from Rodheim an der Bieber

The answer is found in this article written by a Rodheim genalogist and
local historian:

> ["Die Auswanderer aus dem Kirchspiel Rodheim an der Bieber nach
> Nordamerika"](./hessen-peppler\hessische_familienkunde_band_19_heft_7.pdf),
> Ernst Schmidt, September 1989, Hessische Familienkunde, Band 19 Heft
> 7, page 317

This article appeared in the September 1989 issue of **Hessische
familenkunde**, a montly magazine published by the [Arbeitsgemeinschaft
derfamilienkundlichen Gesellschaften in
Hessen](https://wiki.genealogy.net/Arbeitsgemeinschaft_der_familienkundlichen_Gesellschaften_in_Hessen),
(The Working Group of Family Studies Societies in Hesse), the

As the genalogy dates for birth, marriage and emigration show, two
brothers from Fellinghauwen, who appear on page 327(?) of the article,
Johann "John' and Friedrich"Fred/Frederick\" Bender married two Rühl
sisters:

todo: put their genalogical dates here from the article

In 1836 Fred Bender, his wife and 1st child emigrated to the U.S. Then
in 1840 Johann, his wife and their two children emigrated in 1840. They
were among 60 poor people to emigrate that year, and the town gave each
family some financial support for their journey.

By the 1850 U.S. census, both Bender families are now living in the area
of the yet-future Soest Emmanuel Lutheran church. The Pepplers settled
there in 1857. In fact, their farm was right next to the Bender's (not
sure which Bender brother, for sure).

Their eldest son Ludwig "Louis", grandpa Walter's grandfather, would
marry Mary Margarethe Bender, the daughter of John Bender.

So the Pepplers came to Allen county because of they knew the
Benders....

The story of how Friedrich Bender came to Allen county is described in a
[Note](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/collaborate/LBHW-89D)
attached to Eleonore Christine Rühl, Friedrich's wife. The Note
explains:

> Frederick Bender was the son of John Frederick Bender who immigrated
> from Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany to America in 1836, settling near
> Albany, New York. A son Frederick was born to them August 21, 1837.
> His father worked for a time as a teamster to pull the boats through
> the Erie Canal. Not liking the country, he emigrated westward by
> covered wagon with his brother John Bender and their families. They
> traveled on the Wayne Trace Road coming to the Soest Community near
> Fort Wayne, Indiana. They settled here, clearing the trees from the
> land, built a log cabin until a more substantial house could be built.
> Three more children were born to the family. The fathers were charter
> members of the Emmanuel Lutheran Church which was organized Dec 25,
> 1845 at Soest on the Trace Road, which today is Southwest of Fort
> Wayne, in Allen County.

> Here young Frederick grew to manhood helping his father with the

> union were born five sons and two daughters. The youngest son George
> died of Diptheria at age 8 and the father also on Nov. 19, 1871. Both

> In the 1880s, the two older sons came west to Seward County, Nebraska

> 12, 1891, the first burial on the cemetery. She was 88 years of age.

> Frederick Bender farmed here for the rest of his life, passing away

The FamilySearch Life Sketch for [Frederick Bender
Jr](https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/9ZS9-YFF) explains

> On 20 July 1862, Frederick Bender and Anna Marie Fuchshuber were
> married by Rev. Charles Adams at St. Mark's Lutheran Church, on Thiele
> Road in Allen County, Pleasant Township, Indiana, in a log cabin
> church. Their youngest son, George, died of diptheria at age 8, as did
> his grandfather John Frederick, on November 19, 1871. Both are buried
> at the Emmanuel Lutheran Church cemetery, Soest, Indiana. In the
> 1880s, the two older Bender sons came west to Seward County, Nebraska,
> while working for the railroad. Fred purchased 80 acres southwest of
> Ruby, and in October 1887 he moved his family to Nebraska. Coming with

> Congregation. Here they built a church, a parsonage, and a cemetery
> plot. Eleonora Bender, his mother, passed away on 12 December 1891,
> and she was the first person buried in the cemetery.

The FindAGrave memorial for [Frederick Bender
Jr](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/63678411/frederick-bender) also
gives this sketch of his life:

> Frederick was the first child born to Johann and Alora Bender in
> Albany, New York. At the age of 5, Frederick and his parents moved to
> Fort Wayne, Indiana. He married Anna Marie Fuchshuber and five
> children were born in Indiana to this union. After two older sons,
> Martin and Louis, came to Seward County looking for employment, the
> entire family moved west and settled on land purchased from the
> Burlington Railroad in 1887. The family at that time consisted of
> Frederick, Anna, his mother, Alora, and children Elizabeth, Christina,
> John Frederick, and William. His father and one son had died in
> Indiana. (Taken from Seward County Nebraska 1982)

### Hessische familiengeschichtliche Vereingung

The [Hessische familiengeschichtliche Vereingung
(HfV)](https://www.hfv-ev.de), Hessian Family History Assocation, was
founded in 1921 to (as its "About Us" states):

> Access to sources such as registry office books and church books is
> not always easy. Joint research and the exchange of results make work
> easier. For this reason, the Hessian Family History Association (HfV)
> was founded in Darmstadt in 1921. It essentially works on the three
> former provinces of the old Grand Duchy of Hesse and the People's
> State of Hesse: Starkenburg, Oberhessen and Rheinhessen. In addition,
> former areas of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, e.g. B. County of
> Lichtenberg (Pirmasens), Hessian hinterland.

> The other two clubs in Hesse were founded almost at the same time as
> our club. The Society for Family History in Kurhessen and Waldeck
> (GFKW) and the Family History Society for Nassau and Frankfurt
> (FG/FGNF).

> In recent years, the HfV has been able to greatly expand its range of
> services through the support of its members and will continue to work
> to help our members with their research.

The HfV works to:

1.  digitize and transcribe church book dupicats records, whose
    originals are in the Darmstadt State Archives

2.  describe the HfV's holdings--periodicals, family history books,
    local literature.

Descriptions of its holdings are maintained at GenWiki's [Archive of the
Hessian Family History
Association](https://wiki-genealogy-net.translate.goog/Kategorie:Archiv_der_Hessischen_familiengeschichtlichen_Vereinigung_e.V.?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en-US&_x_tr_hl=en-US).
HfV's digitzation effort seeks to:

> We would like to provide as many of the documents that are important
> for our work area as possible in our member area.

> One focus is on the digitization of church book duplicates. The
> originals are in the Darmstadt State Archives and we have the
> opportunity to scan them in the office. The order of the congregations
> is determined by the members. There is information about this in the
> monthly newsletter and in the news on the homepage.

> If you are interested, please send an email to the managing director
> at it\@hfv-ev.de

> Transcription Effort

> Fewer and fewer people can read old manuscripts.

> We have therefore built in the option of typing in the most important
> information in fields on each page of the duplicate church records in
> the members' area. On the one hand, it is easier for less experienced
> users to understand the entries. On the other hand, you can also
> search for entries.

> A few church book duplicates are fully transcribed. Many have little
> or no recorded entries.

> Which books you work on is up to you. Here, too, it is possible to
> work from home.

> If you have any questions, please email the managing director at
> it\@hfv-ev.de

#### Hessische familiengeschichtliche Vereingung

The [Hessische familiengeschichtliche Vereingung
(HfV)](https://www.hfv-ev.de), Hessian Family History Assocation, was
founded in 1921 to (as its "About Us" states):

> Access to sources such as registry office books and church books is
> not always easy. Joint research and the exchange of results make work
> easier. For this reason, the Hessian Family History Association (HfV)
> was founded in Darmstadt in 1921. It essentially works on the three
> former provinces of the old Grand Duchy of Hesse and the People's
> State of Hesse: Starkenburg, Oberhessen and Rheinhessen. In addition,
> former areas of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt, e.g. B. County of
> Lichtenberg (Pirmasens), Hessian hinterland.

> The other two clubs in Hesse were founded almost at the same time as
> our club. The Society for Family History in Kurhessen and Waldeck
> (GFKW) and the Family History Society for Nassau and Frankfurt
> (FG/FGNF).

> In recent years, the HfV has been able to greatly expand its range of
> services through the support of its members and will continue to work
> to help our members with their research.

The HfV works to:

1.  digitize and transcribe church book dupicats records, whose
    originals are in the Darmstadt State Archives

2.  describe the HfV's holdings--periodicals, family history books,
    local literature.

Descriptions of its holdings are maintained at GenWiki's [Archive of the
Hessian Family History
Association](https://wiki-genealogy-net.translate.goog/Kategorie:Archiv_der_Hessischen_familiengeschichtlichen_Vereinigung_e.V.?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en-US&_x_tr_hl=en-US).
HfV's digitzation effort seeks to:

> We would like to provide as many of the documents that are important
> for our work area as possible in our member area.

> One focus is on the digitization of church book duplicates. The
> originals are in the Darmstadt State Archives and we have the
> opportunity to scan them in the office. The order of the congregations
> is determined by the members. There is information about this in the
> monthly newsletter and in the news on the homepage.

> If you are interested, please send an email to the managing director
> at it\@hfv-ev.de

> Transcription Effort

> Fewer and fewer people can read old manuscripts.

> We have therefore built in the option of typing in the most important
> information in fields on each page of the duplicate church records in
> the members' area. On the one hand, it is easier for less experienced
> users to understand the entries. On the other hand, you can also
> search for entries.

> A few church book duplicates are fully transcribed. Many have little
> or no recorded entries.

> Which books you work on is up to you. Here, too, it is possible to
> work from home.

> If you have any questions, please email the managing director at
> it\@hfv-ev.de

> Village and family history Responsible: Karl-Heinz Reeh Vetzbergerstr.
> 21, 35444 Biebertal, Tel.: 06409/9826 The working group exists since
> the foundation of the association in 1995. With Ernst Schmidt a
> Rodheimer Urgestein was until at the beginning of of 2004 the leader
> of this working group.

> On 26.1.2004 Karl-Heinz Reeh and Heinz Peppler were elected as
> successors for Ernst Schmidt. Heinz Peppler passed away in 2014.

> The local history and family researcher known as "Platte Ernst" was
> responsible for a special exhibition in the local history museum
> Rodheim-Bieber in February 2002. Under the title "The life's work of
> Ernst Schmidt as a local historian and family researcher of Rodheim"
> he made his complete activities accessible in the large room of the
> local history museum. All his books and treatises, a lot of picture
> material as well as some family trees of Rodheim families (altogether
> nearly 20) were shown. In 2011 Ernst Schmidt passed away in his 93rd
> year.

> 50th anniversary of the foundation of the singing club Eintracht
> Rodheim on July 05, 1914.

> The working group has taken on the task of researching and documenting
> village and family history. This includes recording oral traditions in
> writing as well as archiving old pictures and, as far as possible,
> describing what has been photographed.

> In order to view documents in archives, which are often written in the
> old Kurrent script (Sütterlin), it is a great advantage to be able to
> read them.

> The temporary exhibitions in the local history museum are also largely
> designed by the working group.

> Not only the history of the village but also historical places outside
> the village are researched, such as the old entrenchments, the
> Königstuhl, the old shooting ranges, the caves at Dünsberg and near
> Bieber, forester's lodges, mills and the old water chamber to name but
> a few.

> Also current documentations belong to it, like photographing buildings
> which are to be torn down. People who have time and interest to join
> us are always welcome.

#### Hessen Church Records

-   [Zentralarchiv der Evangelischen Kirche in Hessen und Nassau
    (EKHN)](https://helmut-hild-haus.de/index.html)

    This
    [page](https://helmut-hild-haus.de/index/einzelansicht/news/kirchenbuchportal-weitere-gemeinden-online-1.html)
    explains its church books are being digitized on made available on
    [Archion.de](https://archion.de).

Archion's [EKHN
records](https://www.archion.de/en/browse/?no_cache=1&path=40821-623350-623353-855430&cHash=e060d4217d1a59919a330f97efeb7848#https://www.archion.de/en/browse/?no_cache=1&path=40821-564945)
appear organized by **Dekanant**, which translates as "dearnary". The
"dean" seems to have been a sort of regional Lutheran/Protestant paster
responsible for a region.

-   The EKHN's church book finder?? [search
    tool](https://www.ekhn-zentralarchiv.findbuch.net/php/main.php?ar_id=3669)
    describes the Dekanat of Gießen and explains when Rodheim became
    part of it.

There is also another church archive in the state of Hessen, but its
holding a more specifically regional:

-   [Landeskirchliches Archiv der Evangelischen Kirche von
    Kurhessen-Waldeck](http://www.archiv-ekkw.de/)

#### Zugehörigkeit zu Sankt Johannis Gemeinde

They were members of the Sankt Johannis Gemeinde, just north of Emmanuel
(Soest), on the esat side of Wayne Trace just north day of I-469. They
were a splinter congregation of Emmanuel according it
[history](http://www.emmanuelsoest.org/our-history/).

#### Marriage of Ludwig "Louis" Peppler to daughter of the Benders from Fellinghausen

Ludwig "Louis" married Mary Bender, who was born in Indiana, but whose
parents were from Fellinghausen, Hessen-Darmstadt, very close to
Rodheim-Bieber. Who else was from Fellinghausen--the Felds? Did they all
come in chain-migration?

todo: create a timeline and map of where they lived in old country and
where they lived in Marion twp, allen, Indiana.

FANS strategy ideas:

-   Sankt Johannis Gemeinde Mitgleider from Rodheim?

    Church register and other members, possibly from Rodheinm.

-   Any neighbors from Rodheim?

-   Newspaper articles about their son who survived. Did his obituary
    mention his birth place?

-   What about the Peppler Bible?
