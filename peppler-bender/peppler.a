== The Pepplers and Benders from Rodheim an der Bieber

=== Introduction

The first Peppler family to settle in Allen County, Indiana, emigrated in April 1857 from *Rodheim an der Bieber* (Rodheim on the Bieber,
a stream), a small village in the Grand Duchy of Hessen, today the federal state of Hesse, one of 17 German states. On April 1,
1954 (citaiton: from Hesseniinfosystemg gazetteer or other subsource from this website, or even wikipedia) *Rodheim an der Bieber* was renamed *Rodheim-Bieber*. 

Four Pepplers from Rodheim emigrated in 1847. A search for "Peppler" in the Hessian emigrant https://www.lagis-hessen.de/en/subjects/index/sn/ha[database] gives these https://www.lagis-hessen.de/en/subjects/gsearch/sn/ha?q=Peppler&submit=LAGIS+Search[results].

=== Early Clues
Because Germany did not become a nation-state until 1871, no national records of any genealogical significance exist for ancestors who emigrated
in the mid nineteenth century. The most important German genealogical records are local parish church books, which began to be kept after the 
Reformation. In ??? Martin Luter published his 95?7,  these in ???. After the Peace of Augsburg in..Peace of Augusburg... They list parentage, birth date, confirmation dates, marriages, and so on. 

But to find the home town or village, we have to start with clues we find in U.S. records and work backwards, connecting the dots as we go.

After German ancestors arrive in the U.S., we usually can find them in U.S. censuses, which began "in 1790, and has been taken every ten years since. 
(https://www.archives.gov/research/census[National Archives, Census Records])."
find them in passenger ship arrival lists. Passenger lists of ships arriving from foreign ports were a legal requirement that  bean as early as ????. 

To figuing out their German hometown 

****
For centuries ``Germany'' existed as an empire composed of a conglomeration of principalities (Fürstentum), duchies
(Herzogtum), grand duchies (Großherzogtum), free cities, etc., each with its own ruler or prince. In ??? there were over of over 300 such ???, At the top of the
ruling hierarchy stood the Emperor, crowned by the Pope (although for practical reasons he was crowned by proxy by the Archbishop ???, in
Aachen??). large like ????). The Protestant Reformation ensured a the empire late of cohesion, but it gave rise to church books….. todo:
mention Heiliges Römanisches Reich was used – quote Pete Wilson – in the 17th century)

Perhaps comment on size of the states within the empire, mentiong that were some small regions like the the principalites of
Schaumburg/Schumburg-Lippe???

It wasn’t until the 17?? century [Peter Wilson quote from youtube interview] that the
Empire was also referred to as the the Holy Roman Empire (Der Heiliges
Römisches Reich).

The Empire came to an end in 1806 when Napolean, with the support of 17?
German princes, forced the last empeor Francis II to abdicate or face
war. With the abdication came the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1806 Napolean with the help of 16 German princes forced the last German emperor to abdicate or face war.

The Pepplers came from the Grand Duchy of Hesse which was created in
1806 (the year the last Holy roman Emperor abdicated and dissolved the
Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation), just three years before the
birth of our 3x great grandfather, Johan Jokab Beppler’s birth. 
****

The Beppler surname later became Peppler. Johann Jakob nmarried Magdelane
Platt in ????. They would have three children. Only the first born would
have a long life.

* Johann Jacob Peppler (1810-1873), his wife
* Magdelane nee Platt Peppler (1810-1901), and their three children:

At that time, Germany was not yet united as a nation, rather it existed
as an association of states that included the sate of Hesse. Rodheinm
today is called Rodheim-Bieber, and it is located over 150 miles south
of the home towns of the Krueckebergs and the Behrmans, whose villages
in northern Germany were relatively close.
