== Tips on Using Asciidoctor

=== Include Directive

To include an image files directly from the defaults `images` folder:

`include::file-name.jpg[]` 

`include::file-name.png[]`. 

The `[]` can contain further image parameters settings such as width and height. The default images folder is `images`. You can change it: 

___
`:includedir: myimagesdir`
___

To include other asciidoc files:

`include::other-doc.adoc[]`

=== Custom Stylesheet

See https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/html-backend/custom-stylesheet[Apply a Custom Stylesheet]

I think you can specify your own stylesheet with:

`:stylesheet: mysytles.css`

You can also override parts of the default stylesheet. The details are mentioned on the Asciidoctor site.
