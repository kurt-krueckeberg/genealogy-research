I have been creating `~/r` subfolders with the latest research issues. They were initially created for families:

* The Bender and Peppler and other families who came from Hesse and settled in Marion township

* The Weiland family and others who came wit the Joahnn Heinrich Krueckberg family, 5 Nov 1849.
  
  - I belive Johann Heinrich Krueckeberg was a cousin to my 3x great grandfather

  - The Bleekes, of course, came first. And they came from the same general aread around Minden as
    the Weilands. Valhsing.

But other families also came on the same ship together. Wit the Pepplers came Dudenhoefers and Doesnges (and maybe others?), who may have settled in Allen County.
In 1849, the Weiland family and the Johann Heinrich Krueckeberg came together. And others?
In 1850, others came with the the Krueckebergs.

When did the Baade, Wiebke, Harman, etc familes come together?

So there was prior relationships of either marriage, friendship or church fellowship that led several families to travel on the same ship. Later on


* Some of their children mrried on another.

* These familiies settled in the sections of townships and found Lutheran churches together.

* They lived near one another.
  - This was especially true when children married. they often settle next to parents, who may have helped them obtain land.

* Later were witnesses to Wills or Land Deeds, of one another.

The effort is to notice, document and trace these relationships. Thus discovering a joint family narrative.
