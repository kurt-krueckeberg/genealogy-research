=== Note Land Ownership from Censuses

Note the fact that certain census years show *land ownership*. Onwership implies a land purchase with resultant real property purchase record(s)--deeds,
perhaps mortgages.

Before s.o. moved, they usually sold their land. when they arrive, they purcahsed land. The purcahse may have happned before they moved.

* Note census land owernship for all ancestors, and add this this fact in my Ancestry tree. 
* Note also those from the same areas--like Beners and Pepplers--who residede next to or near one another.
* Find those ancestors and fans who had such land ownership noted on cenesuses., and the look for the land record(s)
* look for *dower release*s, appluing what you can learn from it to my ancestors.
* Look for...(whatever my reading says to note and record).
