I have been creating subfolder with the latest thread and progress of specific research issues related to:

* The Bender and Peppler and other families who came from Hesse and settled in Marion township

* The Weiland family and others who came wit the Joahnn Heinrich Krueckberg family, 5 Nov 1849.
  
  - I belive Johann Heinrich Krueckeberg was a cousin to my 3x great grandfather

  - The Bleekes, of course, came first. And they came from the same general aread around Minden as
    the Weilands. Valhsing.

Both with those fomr Hesse and those from the Minden ara, the effort is connection relations that are seen
by 

* intermarried among children of those originally from the same parished or same area in Germany

* those who came together one the same ship and often settled next to each other and...

* helped found german Lutheran churches.

* Later were witnesses to Wills or Land Deeds, etc.

The effort is to see and find all those relationships.
