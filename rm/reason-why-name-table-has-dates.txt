Both these queries return the same number or result rows:

SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1;
SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having  tuple_total > 1;

Joining the two results

select r1.OwnerID, total_names, r2.BirthYear, r2.DeathYear, tuple_total from (SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1) as r1
join
(SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having  tuple_total > 1) as r2
on r1.OwnerID=r2.OwnerID;

Joining the two results where total_name != tuple_total        

select r1.OwnerID, total_names, r2.BirthYear, r2.DeathYear, tuple_total from (SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1) as r1
join
(SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having  tuple_total > 1) as r2
on r1.OwnerID=r2.OwnerID
WHERE total_names!=tuple_total;

Why are there BirthYear and DeathYear attributes in the NameTable since they doesn't have anything to do with person's names? And if a person has several names, say, several different given name variations,
the BirthYear and DeathYear are identical for each name variation. 

If you do
SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1 order by OwnerID;

the result rows results are the same as when you group by 'OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear': 

SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having  tuple_total > 1

And this query never returns return any results (at least with the gedcom I imported):

select r1.OwnerID, total_names, r2.BirthYear, r2.DeathYear, tuple_total from (SELECT OwnerID, count(*) as total_names from NameTable group by OwnerID having total_names > 1) as r1
join
(SELECT OwnerID, BirthYear,DeathYear, count(*) as tuple_total from NameTable group by OwnerID, BirthYear, DeathYear having  tuple_total > 1) as r2
on r1.OwnerID=r2.OwnerID
WHERE total_names!=tuple_total;
