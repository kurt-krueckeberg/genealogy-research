== Tables Related to Persons, Names, and Relationships, etc.

=== PersonTable

`PersonTable.PersonID` key identifies a unique person (in the family tree) with unique `UniqueID` (which apparently is a `GUID` or hash value that is **GEDCOM** standard field).

.table PersonTable

|IsPrivate Int |Proof Int |Bookmark Int |Note TEXT |UTCModDate Float

=== NameTable

`NameTable.NameID` key identifies each unique name with surname `Surname`, given name `Given`, birth year `BirthYear` and death year `DeathYear`. The *primary* name appears first in order (with the smallest `NameID`)
and any alternate names (typically alternate given names) immediately follow. `OwnerID` is a foreign key corresponding to the `PersonTable.PersonID` who "owns" this name, the person to whom the name belongs. We infer this from two facts:

. `count(OwnerID) == count(PersonID)`, and
. how else can the `PersonID` be linked to their name (and the other associated facts in the `NameTable` mentioned above)?

=== FamilyTable

`FamilyTable` has `FamilyID` key to identify each unique family. The pair `FatherID` and `MotherID` must also clearly be unique. They are no doubt foreign keys that map to
`PersonTable.PersonID`. 

The unique pair `FatherID` plus `MotherID` can have zero or more children. I doubt that a child is required to constitute a family, but Iâ€™m not 100% sure of the predicate for `FamilyTable`.
At any rate, there is no requirement that their offspring ever live and grow up with them.

It appears that if a mother or father is unknown, their `FatherID` or `MotherID` is 0.

*Todo:* Figure out if a Family means they have children. Use my Frankenstein tree. Give a wife to the son, but no children.

.table FamilyTable
[width="99%",cols="18%,5%,5%,4%,5%,5%,5%,4%,6%,6%,6%,7%,7%,7%,4%,6%",]

|HusbOrder Int |WifeOrder Int |IsPrivate Int |Proof Int |SpouseLabel Int
|FatherLabel Int |MotherLabel Int |SpouseLabelStr TEXT |FatherLabelStr
TEXT |MotherLabelStr TEXT |Note TEXT |UTCModDate Float

=== ChildTable 

`ChildTable` has key `RecID`. The `ChildID` is no doubt a foreign key referencing the `PersonTable.PersonID`, and `FamilyID` must be a foreign key referencing `FamilyTable.FamilyID`. All
children with the same `FamilyID` belong to the same family in the sense that they have the same set of parents.

Can a child belong to more than one family? 
And what if a person does not yet have an assigned parents. In this case, there would be no entry for them in the `ChildTable` or `FamilyTable`.

.table ChildTable

=== DB Questions to Figure Out

Figure out if "family" means there must be a child. To test this use my Frankenstein tree. Give a wife to the son, but give them no children, expert and import to rootsmagic.
And create a SQL join statment, left or right join, to determine if there persons with no parents.

SQL to show persons with no children is also desired.

=== Ancestry Medis Files

Incorporate my notes for assigning Ancestry Media Gallery files to the correct person.

=== New DB with Forign Key Contrainst

After figure out the question above, dump the Rootsmagic db and import it into a new DB that has the foreign key contraints described above.

=== Other 

- Look into Webtrees and its tables.

- Look into Tim Forsythe's GEDCOM 5 validator writtenin C++.
