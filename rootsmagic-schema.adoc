== Analysis of Main Tables Describing Persons, Names, and Relationshiups

The `PersonTable.PersonID` is the key for all unique individuals in a
tree. In a addition to the `PersonID` key, the unique `UniqueID` column
is likely a `GUID` of some sort, perhaps related to GEDOM field?

The `NameTable` has key `NameID` that uniquely identifies every nane
used in the tree. These are each person's main names and any alternate
names they have. Each row of the `NameTable` also has an `OwnerID`
desginating to whom the name belongs. This is a foregin key that no
doubt maps to `PersonTable.PersonID`. This derives from the fact that
1.) the count of `OnwerID` s is equal to the count of the `PersonID`s ,
the unique persons in the tree, and 2.) this links the Person with
unique `PersonID` to the name(s), which must be done.

It appears that the first `NameID`, of the set of `NameID` s that all
have the same `OnwerID`, is the "main" name used, and the subsequents
names in the set are the 'alternate' names.

Thus a person in the `PersonTable` identified by their `PersonID` has a
"main" name, but can also have several alternate names. These are
usually just given names rather than surnames.

The `FamilyTable` has a primary key of `FamilyID`. The columns
`FatherID` and `MotherID` are no doubt foreign keys that map to
`PersonTable.PersonID`. The pair `FatherID` plus `MotherID` is also
mostly likely unique since the children from the same couple are cpart
of the same family entity, even if the family is not a traditional
nuclear family or even one in which the children grow up. Every child
has a unique set of father and mother. Iâ€™m not sure if the `FamilyTable`
only models couples that have chilren? Some couples (either
intentionally or otherwise) have no children.

If a mother or father is unknown it appears that their `FatherID` or
`MotherID` is 0.

A FamilyTable allows us to model the fact that a specific mand or a
specific woman may have children by more than one person, more than one
`PersonID`.

The `NameTable` also has the `BirthYear` and `DeathYear`.

The concept of a child and children is modelled by the `ChildTable`.
Each child in this table has a unique `RecID`. The `ChildID` is no doubt
a foreign key that maps to `PersonID`. There is also a `FamilyID` that
no doubt is a foreign key that maps to `FamilyTable.FamilyID`. All
children with the same `FamilyID` belong to the same family in the sense
that they have the same set of parents.

Perhaps not every person in a tree yet has an idenitifable set of
parents. In this case, there would be no entry for them in the
`ChildTable` or `FmailyTable`.
